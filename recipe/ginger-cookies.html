    <p>Big, soft, gingerbread cookies made with molasses, ginger, and other spices are a holiday favorite. This
        gingerbread cookie recipe for ginger cookies rolled in sugar is my oldest son's favorite. Store cooled cookies
        in an airtight container and they will stay soft for days.</p>
    <ol>
        <h2>steps:</h2>
        <li>Sugar: You'll need about a cup of sugar for the cookie dough, plus about two tablespoons of sugar for rolling the dough balls.</l1>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cookies structure and helps create a tender texture..</li>
        <li>Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into balls, roll the balls in sugar, and flatten them slightly.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven until almost set and cool on a wire rack</li>
    </ol>
